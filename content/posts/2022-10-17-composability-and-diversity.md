History repeats itself.  It especially feels that way in the blockchain security space.

One of the advantages of blockchain (and the early days of the internet) is composability -- our ability to build on someone else's work.  Often because it's open source.

A recent hack on Binance chain was the result of composability.  Code had been taken from one project and imported into Binance chain.  Turns out that code had a bug.

In 1989, Clifford Stoll wrote in a fantastic book on one of the first documented hacking attempts.  He writes 30 years ago "diversity in software is a good thing."

As we build on to the open source internet with open source blockchain components, we should be thinking about composability, diversity and of course security.
