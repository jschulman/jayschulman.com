Today marks the 35th week of publishing the [security longreads](https://www.jayschulman.com/security-longreads) newsletter. I’m often asked how long it must take me to put the newsletter together each week. Amazingly, only about 15 minutes. Here is my process:

#### Finding Content

If you’ve ever heard me give a presentation, you’d probably ask how I keep up with the ever changing information security field. I read. A lot. I’ve created a master list of websites I trust to keep me up-to-date on the world around us. That’s all kept in [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/). On the train to and from work each day, I go through Feedly looking for what is interesting to read.

#### Saving Content for Later

It’s not unusual for me to find a half dozen articles I want to read on the way into the office. All of those are tagged and automatically imported into [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com). Pocket is a *read it later* service which downloads all of my saved articles to my tablet for later reading. For better or worse, Pocket has more than 100 articles in queue right now.

#### Reading

This is where the process breaks down. There are far too many good articles and too little time to read them. I have the best of intentions that I’m going to get to [Why Everyone Seems to Have Cancer](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/sunday-review/why-everyone-seems-to-have-cancer.html?utm_source=scoopinion&amp;_r=0), a New York Times article from January 2014. (FYI, I commited reading bankruptcy last January, so this is the oldest article in the queue.)

I read on airplanes, before bed, at the lunch counter. Pocket makes it easy to have the latest (or oldest) articles already downloaded and ready to read. No internet necessary.

#### Curating the Security Longreads Newsletter

On Thursday nights, I sit down at my computer and open up the Pocket desktop app and review all of the content from the past 7 days. To publish the newsletter, I use a service called [Goodbits](http://www.goodbits.io). With a Chrome app, I bring up each article, load it into Goodbits and schedule to send it out at 10 am Central on Friday.
