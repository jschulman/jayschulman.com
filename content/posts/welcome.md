### Welcome to JaySchulman.com.

## What is this website all about?

I spend a considerable amount of time engaging on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jschulman).  It's great for the daily post but I don't find it valuable for long form writing.

I hope I can write a monthly long form article on blockchain, digital assets and overall innovation in the financial services sector.
