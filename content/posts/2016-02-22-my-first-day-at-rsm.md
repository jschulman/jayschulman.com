In case you missed it, I recently posted a podcast episode on my experiences looking for a job. (You can find that [here](https://www.jayschulman.com/jay-gets-a-job/).) Based upon those experiences I wrote up a bunch of tips to help you with your job search. (That’s [here](https://www.jayschulman.com/hacking-your-infosec-job-hunt/).)

The result of many hours of interviews is that I accepted a position to join the partnership at RSM US LLP. At RSM (formerly McGladrey), I’ll be a Principal leading the Security and Privacy Consulting Practice in the Great Lakes Region. I join a great group of people at a time when RSM’s client base is clamouring for security help.

RSM sold me on their corporate culture, people, and emphasis my abilities to not only help clients but help people grow their careers.

If you’re reading this on Monday, I’m likely sitting in orientation learning much more about the company and processes. I’m sure I’ll have much more to write about RSM in the days and months ahead.
