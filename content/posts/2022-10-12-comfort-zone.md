I've been studying when people have their "light bulb moment" about blockchain and digital assets for the past ~3 years.  The single best indicator of the light bulb moment is when they are "open to new possibilities."

There are two key points here:

1) You as the learner have to be in the right mindset to learn about things that might not keep you safe and in control.  I can't just hand you a whitepaper and expect that you'll buy into it.

2) As an innovator, you're 3 steps ahead of most others when you're in the "Connecting Ideas Zone."  It seems so obvious to you but you're trying to explain something to someone who needs to feel safe and in control.

Now the key question is: how do we spend more time in the curiosity zone?
