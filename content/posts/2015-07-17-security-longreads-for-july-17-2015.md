**Commentary:** First up is an article from 538 (the statistics blog from ESPN) about what you can do with 1mil stolen OPM fingerprints (find spies). Next, how the Chief Security Architect is more important than a CISO. The intersection of DevOps and Security (a counterargument to my beliefs, FYI). And finally, how the US government has the same problem as everyone else (finding good security people).

In Other Reads, how the idea of being productive is bad. And why I should never hear your phone. (And you shouldn’t have a smartwatch either.)
