A recent article in the [Harvard Business Review](http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/11/the-rise-of-the-rude-hiring-manager/) on *The Rise of the Rude Hiring Manager* had an interesting side comment:

> During the last decade, it became acceptable behavior to simply not answer e-mails. But that’s the worst kind of ego-sucking, demoralizing power play imaginable. We’re all busy. That’s no excuse for disrespect.

I don’t know the percentage of my unsolicited e-mails that get a response (less than half), but I don’t take it personally. Interestingly, the writer of the article, Anne Kreamer, wrote the book [It’s Always Personal: Navigating Emotion in the New Workplace](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400067979/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400067979&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jayschulman-20&amp;linkId=56AUHEE4DMYGFGIG)

.

As Anne points out, it’s acceptable **not **to respond to e-mails. In fact when I personally don’t respond to e-mails, I usually get a “Jay, I know you must be really busy since you haven’t had a chance to respond…” It’s a burden to respond, right? I’d be up until all hours of the night letting people know that I’m not interested.

I’d like to think I’m not ego-sucking. Unfortunately, it’s acceptable. I’d like to change that.

#### The 30 Day Challenge

There is no way to understand *the burden* until you try it out. For the next thirty days, I’m going to respond to every e-mail. Here are the criteria:

- It has to be personally written. Auto-responders, mailing lists and mass e-mails don’t count. If someone is taking the time to write me, I’m going to take the time to write them back.
- The response time should dictate the urgency of the e-mail but it should take no more than 3 business days to respond.
- At least a full sentence polite response for each e-mail. (“No thanks” doesn’t count.)
- Closure to the thread. So I’ve already started this exercise. Responses beget responses. After a ping-pong back and forth, you can’t leave the conversation dangling. Close it up and let the writer know you’re done.

#### Measuring the Challenge

There are two things I’m looking for in trying this out:

1. How hard and how much time does it take to respond to every personally written e-mail?
2. And most interesting to me, how many of these responses actually turn into an action by me? That is, are there missed opportunities by not responding to the e-mails.

There has to be a balance between the two. If it takes 2 hours a week to respond but I only get one missed opportunity a month, the exercise may not be worth it. I’m guessing that it will be the opposite. I’ll spend 30 minutes a week responding and find one new opportunity each week.

The clock has started.

**p.s.** Some of you reading this have my personal and work e-mails addresses. I’m guessing you’ll add to the e-mail pile to see if I respond. Thanks in advance.
