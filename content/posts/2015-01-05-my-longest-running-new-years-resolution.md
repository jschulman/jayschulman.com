Even though I don’t typically set New Year’s Resolutions ([read here](https://www.jayschulman.com/new-years-resolutions-dont-work/)), there is one New Year’s Resolution that has stuck around for the past five years.

With my resolutions, I’m lucky to make it through January before I forgot what I was trying to accomplish. Not here. This one has gone in fits and spurts. And never accomplished.

#### Going Paperless

Five years ago, iPad in hand, I decided that paper was my enemy. I lost most of it. What I kept I could never find the right piece. Paperless was the answer. Digitally store everything I needed in a single location, easily searchable, and available on my desktop or mobile. People like [Jamie Rubin](http://www.jamierubin.net/going-paperless/) make it look easy. Here is a summary of five years of failures:

#### Year 1

*iPad and *[*Penulitmate*](https://evernote.com/penultimate/). I’m going to write everything on my iPad. I’m going to mark-up documents on my iPad as well.

I can’t actually read my handwriting.

#### Year 2

Upgrade my writing utensil to an [Adonit](http://www.adonit.net/). I actually love writing on an iPad with this.

But I still can’t read my handwriting.

I get a printer/scanner to scan in as much as I can. But the scanner is too darn slow.

#### Year 3

I found this service, [1DollarScan](http://1dollarscan.com/) that I mailed all of my documents to. So instead of standing next to a slow scanner, I throw everything in an envelope, wait for it to be too heavy to mail and send half of it to be scanned.

I type notes directly in to Evernote. It works, but typing on an iPad is much slower than typing at a real keyboard.

I signed up for [FileThis](https://filethis.com/). This was a huge success. FileThis takes all of my electronic invoices/bills/etc from all of my banks and service providers and files them in Evernote (or other services). Small victory.

#### Year 4

2014 was a big year. I bought the Evernote ScanSnap scanner. It’s fast. It does double-sided scanning. Another small victory.

I also decided that I should be writing notes in a notebook with a pen and paper and scanning them in. It works in the short-term (I scan the notes in a timely manner) but fails in the long term (I’m currently months behind scanning them in).

#### Year 5 — This Year

I’m back at it today. My focus for this year is solving some of the smaller problems I’ve had:

- Losing the paper before I can scan it in.
- The best organizational system.
- Automating as much as possible.
- Getting the right documents/information into Evernote.

I have a feeling that this resolution will come back in Year 6.
