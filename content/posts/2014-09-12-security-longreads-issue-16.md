### Security Longreads

#### Issue #16

With a wealth of security reading available, the Security Longreads weekly e-mail is designed to highlight particularly interesting longer reads. Our “Security Reads” covers topics related to Information Security while our “Other Reads” are topics that have nothing to do with security but could be of interest to Information Security professionals.

We all know the basics — strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and so on.

Let’s look at what that is, why it can happen without you knowing, and how you can protect yourself.
