**Commentary:** The two top stories this week have been well publicized — the government getting access to encrypted communications is bad and a hacking company gets hacked. An interesting read from Symantec on the motives behind hacking and a satirical review of the recent OPM announcement. (That’s what you get for releasing the news on July 4th.)

In Other Reads, I’m always curious how criminals use technology so I found the Mob’s use of IT fascinating. Also, a very statistical analysis of what makes a great salesperson.
