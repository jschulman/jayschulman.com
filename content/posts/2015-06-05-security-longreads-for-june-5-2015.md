**Commentary:** The big news (as of yesterday) is the breach of the US’s Office of Personnel Management. I’ve included the first article which ties the OPM breach to Anthem’s breach. I’m sure there is more to come. Netflix is known for their agile development but I’ve included a story on how they build security into their processes. Finally, two articles on the state of the CISO.

In Other Reads, the benefits of being weird and a review of Google Photo’s new photo data-mining.

#### Didn’t get this week’s Security Longreads?
