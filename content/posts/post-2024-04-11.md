Today, we're diving into some fascinating insights from the 2024 Policygenius Financial Planning Survey. The data reveals a striking difference in how younger generations, specifically millennials and Gen Z, are storing their wealth compared to their older counterparts. So, let's get into it!

### The Rise of Cryptocurrency: A Generational Divide

- Gen Z and millennials are almost equally likely to own cryptocurrency (21%) as they are to own real estate (20%)
- This marks a significant shift from traditional wealth storage methods
- In contrast, only 36% of Gen X and baby boomers have tried any of the financial "hacks"
  - Maximizing credit card rewards is the most popular hack for these generations (21% and 19% respectively)

### Gen Z: Crypto Enthusiasts and Financial Experimenters

- **Intriguing finding:** Gen Zers are more likely to own cryptocurrency (20%) than they are to own stocks (18%)!
- 14% of Gen Z have tried "infinite banking" (borrowing against the cash value of a whole life insurance policy)
- This trend suggests that younger generations are more open to:
  - Taking risks with their money
  - Exploring alternative financial strategies

### Social Media: The New Financial Advisor?

- Gen Z and millennials are more than twice as likely to turn to social media first with a financial question (8%) compared to Gen X and baby boomers (2%)
- This reliance on social media for financial guidance could be both a blessing and a curse:
  - It exposes younger generations to innovative ideas
  - But also potential misinformation
