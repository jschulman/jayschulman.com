Recently I posted on the top [Coursera courses for the information security professional.](https://www.jayschulman.com/the-ultimate-coursera-guide-for-the-infosec-professional/) Those are all long form video series that take you on an educational journey. I wanted to focus today on a series of short educational videos you can use to grow your information security career.

I’ve organized the list into different categories depending upon want you want to learn including foundational videos, security metrics, application security, security awareness, and security management.

Recognition goes to Adrian Crenshaw ([Irongeek](http://www.irongeek.com)) who has the passion to record just about every speaker at a conference. Without his efforts, you couldn’t watch these from the comfort of your own computer.
