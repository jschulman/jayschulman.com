#### Issue #63

With a wealth of security reading available, the Security Longreads weekly e-mail is designed to highlight particularly interesting longer reads. Our “Security Reads” covers topics related to Information Security while our “Other Reads” are topics that have nothing to do with security but could be of interest to readers of JaySchulman.com.

**Commentary:** The world is consumed with Blackhat (and soon to be Defcon) presentations. I just couldn’t bring myself to publish many of them this week (see my post on Guns, Toilets and Semis below). I do start off this week with a roundup post on everything interesting at Blackhat. Elsewhere, it came out that the FBI decrypted a Truecrypt volume. If you’ve kept up with Truecrypt, the creators closed it down and many suspected government involvement. An interest read (yet full of hypotheticals). Jeff Moss’s Blackhat keynote on how we’ll all have security jobs — but they’ll be miserable jobs. (So much for “Building A Life” in security.) Finally, it’s hard not to gush about Tesla. As a security guy, it’s good to see the car patched nationwide automatically days before a vulnerability was published.

In Other Reads, I’m big into researching DevOps — and its intersection with security — and this is a good read on the culture. Since it’s summer, the computerization of baseball umpires and how you should work as though your kids are watching. (My daughter joined me at work on Wednesday.)

Happy Weekend,

Black Hat 2015 Speaking at the opening of the 18th Black Hat security conference, its founder Jeff Moss warned the assembled throng that while they might have job security, they weren’t going to have fun in the next decade.

“We are all employed for life,” Moss said. “It’s interesting, I see problems and challenges and on one hand am really excited, but on the other I just want to sleep.”
