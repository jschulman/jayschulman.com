I love this quote from Lindsey McInerney, Co-founder of Sixth Wall, Mila Kunis' Web3 company.

We're definitely studying whether the metaverse can be a good corporate environment -- better teaching, collaboration, or even just meeting place. Â I'm not sure we've yet experimented with doing taxes in the metaverse.

If we're looking for the tipping point of the metaverse -- and by the way we're a long way from the tipping point -- we should be focused on entertainment, not meetings.

I'm much more excited to hang out with Bryan Cranston in the metaverse than Brian Becker, our CEO.
