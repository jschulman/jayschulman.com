excerpt: The complete guide to securing Amazon Web Services.

Welcome to the complete guide to securing Amazon Web Services. As I was researching how to secure my AWS resources, I realized there isn't a one-stop guide for securing every piece of AWS. I've compiled from around the web (including great resources from Amazon, Evident.io, and others) to build this guide.

This guide will be updated as new services arise, configuration changes occur, or other things happen that require an update to the guide.
