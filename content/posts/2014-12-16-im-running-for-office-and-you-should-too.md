Yesterday, I [filed](http://www.jayforoakpark.org/filed) to run for School Board for my local school system. I’m only 20% through the process of running and it’s already been a great experience. If you even the smallest desire to run for an office, I highly encourage you to do it.

#### Understanding the Election System

We all watched *How a Bill Becomes a Law*but few understand the process for getting elected to public office. (Winning the election is the last mile of the marathon.) I had to fill out, sign and get notarized a number of declarations, statements, rules, and disclosures. I had to file a *Statement of Economic Interest*. I don’t really own much, so it wasn’t much work but I appreciate those that do might not want to disclose their economic life to the public. Most importantly, I had to get petitions signed by residents of the school district.

#### Meeting People

Long before politicians go out to shake hands and kiss babies, they need to get registered voters to sign a petition allowing them on the ballot. I expected the common conversation to be *What Do You Stand For?* In fact, it was the opposite. Many people had a story to tell about the school district — something they wanted changed, something “you’d better make sure we keep” or how the money is spent. While I had a set of ideas before getting the petitions, the conversations with each voter shaped my view of what is important.

As you run for bigger offices, the candidate ends up delegating the petition process to volunteers and never ends up talking to the voters. While it’s unreasonable for the Mayor of Chicago to personally get 35,000 signatures, the conversations have been a highlight so far.

#### The Rules

As expected there are a lot of rules to follow. Mess something up and you may not end up on the ballot. (As of this writing, I’m still 9 days away from knowing whether I messed anything up.) I could be disqualified for not *binding* my petitions. Sunday night, I ended up researching the appropriate way to bind. (It turns out, as long as it’s secure, most anything works.)

The stamp above was from the clerk’s office signifying that I registered by 8a on Monday morning. Everyone in line at 8a gets an 8a stamp. Three other candidates for school board also have 8a stamps. There will be a lottery in a few weeks to determine which one of us gets the first position on the ballot.

#### Be Apart of Your Community

Many of the people who signed my petition said *thanks for volunteering*. And certainly when people think about running for School Board or other community boards, that is how they look at it. While I’m excited to give back and I’m also excited to be more connected to my community.

This will likely be the last post here on my campaign. If you’re interested in the journey, please check out my election website at [jayforoakpark.org](http://www.jayforoakpark.org).
