What if unlearning was more important than learning.

You probably think about them as bad habits.  But there are things we have learned -- maybe early in our careers -- that aren't true or relevant anymore.

What is the first place you go to search for something? The next generation of internet users aren't thinking Google as their first stop.  Restaurant recommendations?  TikTok, not Yelp.

So when it comes to transacting on the internet, over the next 5 years we will need to unlearn one set of financial transactions for blockchain enabled transactions.

When is comes to successfully navigating blockchain, Adam Grant is right in Think Again... your success will be driven by your "ability to rethink and unlearn."
