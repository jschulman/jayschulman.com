**Welcome to the Season 1 Masterclass.**

If you’re a subscriber, you’ve heard everything in this episode. But wait! Don’t skip it. The reason I put the Masterclass together was to hear different people’s perspectives back-to-back.

If you’re new to the podcast, this is the episode that will get you up to speed and may send you to specific people’s full interviews. The Masterclass contains just the highlights of what I thought were some really interesting answers over the past 12 weeks.

If you think someone would benefit from listening to the podcast, this is the episode to share.

I’m recording Season 2 of the podcast right now. If you’re interested in appearing on the podcast and have 30 minutes to spare, shoot me an e-mail at podcast@jayschulman.com and we can set something up.

Thanks again for your support and I’ll see you in Season 2 in January.
