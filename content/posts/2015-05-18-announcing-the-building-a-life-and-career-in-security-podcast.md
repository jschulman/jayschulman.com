Today, I officially kick off the pilot episode of ***Building A Life and Career in Security Podcast***. My hope is that you can learn from the stories of how other people have grown their careers. Each episode will contain an interview with a security or development professional on how they got into security and their career journey. I’ll ask three questions of each guest:

- Talk about your journey to your current job
- Talk about a key decision or event that had a positive effect on your career
- Talk about a do-over. Something you’d do differently.
