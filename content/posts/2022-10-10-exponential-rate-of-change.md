The graphic above outlines the paradigm shift rate -- how exponential technologies impact us.

1990s internet compared to 2020s internet is 8x faster and more competitive. You can see it when you look at how fast something like an Alexa device goes from non-existent to "Alexa" being a generic phrase for a smart device.

I subscribe that "blockchain" is the next generation of the internet.  We're going to move from 8x to 16x the growth of the internet in the next 10 years.  Blockchain will be a huge driver in that exponential growth.

It will be hard to keep up unless you start learning, thinking and experimenting with it today.
