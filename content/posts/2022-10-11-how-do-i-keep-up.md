"How do I keep up?"  I've felt that way in blockchain for the past 3 years.  And yet...

Blockchain is probably still in the "This just feels like linear growth" stage. And since we're in a bear market, maybe most feel like nothing is really changing.

The art of keeping up with innovation is figuring out the tipping point.  Based upon this graphic, I'd argue if you can capture the opportunity once you reach the "wow. this feels different" stage then you likely won't be too late or too early.

When will we know blockchain is at "Wow. This feels different?"
