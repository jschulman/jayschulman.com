This morning Amazon officially released my new book “Building A Life and Career in Security.”

It covers a wealth of recommendations and guidance that I’ve followed and recommended to others for the last few years. It starts with getting your career off the ground on Day 1 and goes all the way through recommending steps to develop your executive skills.

#### It’s Free This Week

My objective is to get the book into as many hands as possible. Amazon is happy to promote my book but only if people buy it. Interestingly, if I give my book away, that counts too.

So this week only (Monday through Friday), the eBook version is absolutely free. It won’t be free again until Christmas. (Amazon has rules about that.) So get it now.

#### How to Read an Amazon eBook

“Glad it’s free, but I don’t have a Kindle.” No worries. Amazon Kindle books can be read on iPads, iPhones, Android phones and tablets, and even on your computer. Go [here](http://amzn.to/1F9StBb) to download one of the reading apps.

#### Paperback or eBook?

I know, I bought the paperback book.[/caption]

While I’m a big fan of eBooks, I know a lot of people love the feel of a printed book. Quick note, the book contains a lot of links to resources which are hard to manage in the printed book. You’ll love the clickable nature of the eBook.

If you really want the printed book, I’ve set it up so that if you buy the printed book, you get the eBook for free — all through Amazon.

Either way, you can’t go wrong.
