Hi, I'm Jay Schulman.

I'm a blockchain and digital asset guy. I like to talk. But when no one's listening, I write.

## Useless Things You Should Know About Me:

* But I've traveled to 48 out of 50 states. (Montana and Hawaii are on the bucket list.)
* I fly so much on Southwest Airlines that my wife can fly free with me wherever I go.
* Unfortunately I haven't reached the point where my kids can also fly free.
* In 1999, the FBI said they didn't need someone with my skills.
* Also in 1999, Playboy said they needed my skills. Security skills, that is.
* I turned them down to work for KPMG.
* It worked out ok. 10 years employment. They found me my wife. And how to be a great manager.
* And great examples of how not to manage people.
* Today I work for RSM. They allow me to do this. I think.
