##### A Bit About Me:

* I've traveled to 48 out of 50 states, with Montana and Hawaii on my bucket list.
* In 1999, I turned down an offer from Playboy (for security skills, of course) to work for KPMG.
* My 10-year tenure at KPMG was filled with valuable experiences, both in management and personal life.
* Today, I'm proud to be a part of the RSM team, where I can pursue my passion for blockchain and digital assets.
