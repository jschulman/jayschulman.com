Rug Radio has an interesting NFT model around building a new media company via NFTs.  The model is below.

I think there is a mistake to assume that NFTs are just art or "digital collectibles."  This NFT yields tokens each day and get airdropped into your wallet each month.

Is this art?  Definitely.

Is this a membership pass? Yes, definitely looks like a membership pass.

Is it an investment with yield?  I think that's an open question.
