chain and secured by miners who validate transactions and solve complex mathematical puzzles. This ensures that the network is resistant to attacks and maintains the integrity of the data stored on the blockchain.

Scalability: the second cornerstone of the blockchain trilemma Scalability refers to the ability of a blockchain network to handle a large number of transactions and users without experiencing significant delays or increasing fees. This is a crucial aspect for widespread adoption of blockchain technology in various industries.
