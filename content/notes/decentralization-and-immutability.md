Really interesting action by Dapper Labs today:

Without getting into the details of why Dapper did what they did, our assumption is that NFTs are immutable.  You buy an NFT and no one can take it away from you.

It turns out the old bitcoin mantra "not your keys, not your coin" is just as relevant with NFTs.  Platforms will be pressured to allow users to take their assets off platform and on-chain.
