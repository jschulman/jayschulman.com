Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance platform built on Ethereum that offers coverage for smart contract vulnerabilities and other risks associated with DeFi. What sets it apart from other decentralized insurance providers? Its unique, community-driven approach:

- 🤝 **Mutual Model**: Nexus Mutual operates as a discretionary mutual, which means members pool their funds to cover each other's risks. This model aligns everyone's interests and fosters a shared sense of responsibility.
- 👥 **Community Governance**: The power is in the hands of the people! Nexus Mutual's governance is controlled by its members. By staking the platform's native token, NXM, users can participate in decision-making, such as voting on risk assessment and policy changes.
- 🔧 **Claims Assessment**: Claims are assessed and approved by the community, ensuring a transparent and decentralized process.
