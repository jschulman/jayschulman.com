At RSM, we developed the Blockchain Fellowship, a deep educational intensive to help the entire firm understand the power of blockchain and its impact on the services we provide.  Through the power of Generative AI, I've been able to take the core concepts and turn them into 100 lessons on blockchain and digital assets.
